# Module 3 - Data Frame Assignment
**By: Steven Barden**  
**Due: Monday, 8 AM**  

## Election Poll Analysis
For this assignment, I analyzed a fictional dataset representing poll results from the 2016 presidential election using R. The dataset includes poll numbers from two sources: **ABC and CBS**. After correcting minor syntax issues in the given dataset, I created a structured **data frame** to store and process the information.  

### **The candidates in the dataset are:**
**Jeb, Donald, Ted, Marco, Carly, Hillary, and Bernie**  

### **The poll results are as follows:**

| Candidate | ABC Poll | CBS Poll |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Jeb       | 4       | 12      |
| Donald    | 62      | 75      |
| Ted       | 51      | 43      |
| Marco     | 21      | 19      |
| Carly     | 2       | 1       |
| Hillary   | 14      | 21      |
| Bernie    | 15      | 19      |

## **Analysis and Observations**
- **Donald Trump** leads in both **ABC (62%)** and **CBS (75%)** polls.
- **Ted Cruz** follows with **51% (ABC)** and **43% (CBS)**.
- **Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders** show similar numbers, but **Hillary is slightly ahead in CBS polls**.
- **Carly Fiorina** has the **lowest polling numbers**, with only **2% (ABC) and 1% (CBS)**.
- Polling discrepancies exist, with **some candidates performing better in CBS vs. ABC and vice versa**.

## **Code Implementation**
The R script I developed for this assignment **ensures data integrity, performs summary statistics, and generates visualizations**. The implementation includes:
- **Data validation** to check for errors in input.
- **Summary statistics** to provide insights into the dataset.
- **A bar chart visualization** to compare ABC and CBS poll numbers.

## **Visualization**
A **bar chart** was generated to visualize the poll results, showing how candidates performed in **ABC vs. CBS polling sources**.

## **Conclusion**
This dataset provides a **fictional** yet structured look at polling numbers in a **2016-style election scenario**. While polling numbers suggest **Donald Trump had a strong lead**, the discrepancies between different polling agencies highlight how results can **vary based on methodology and sample selection**. Understanding how polls are structured and analyzed is crucial for making **data-driven interpretations in political science and statistics**.
